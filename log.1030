# git 
    when local branch delete files


    If you deleted a file from the working tree, then commit the deletion:

        git commit -a -m "A file was deleted"

    And push your commit upstream:

        git push


    To push a local branch to remote and track it too,
    In Git 1.7.0+ you can do the following:

        $ git checkout -b feature_branch_name
        #... edit files, add and commit ...
        $ git push -u origin feature_branch_name

    and it will set up the tracking information during the push

    To use milli_uuid as unique file/folder id.

    The chance of a uuid clash is small enough, but it can accumulate, 
    which means if file id put in one name space, the chance to clash also
    accumulate.  milli_uuid will split it but milli seconds, so it can not
    accumulate.

bare coffee to js
-----------------

    # using:
    coffee -o to/js/path/ -cw src/path/of/coffee/scripts

    # `-b` option to stop adding file wrapper, So can be load by node.js REPL
    coffee -b -o to/js/path/ -cw src/path/of/coffee/scripts


mocha testing fails randomly
----------------------------

This kills, the reason is out of common debuging.
It might be: coffee scripts conversion, promise mess up callbacks, or mocha itself.

mocha.js test, timeout
