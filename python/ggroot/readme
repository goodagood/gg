Python's way of import can be trouble and clumsy.
When name conflict happen, it make me not sure if my module get import first.

So, this folder is here, 
because it's parent folder set to be $PYTHONPATH,
currently it is with the structure:
    .../gg/python          # parent and $PYTHONPATH
    .../gg/python/ggroot   # this directory

In short, ggroot, this directory is used to save import conflict,
and save the brain twisting.
