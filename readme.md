Work as a web file system, using aws s3 as storage.  It will be better to add
other web storage as backend.


# Reason

There must be a lot web file system, why bother to build another?  

The first reason is I am stupid, and try to make myself happy by hacking
and engineering.

Among existing web file systems, some are good but they are cut off by my
ISPs.  The rest is too awkward to be use by me, a stupid.

So I am build a web file system to satisfy myself, 

1, File should be easy to change presentations, same as folder.

2, Files should be able to get value, because we work on them.  

3, it's better to be able to work from command line.
