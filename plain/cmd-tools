ack-grep -l  pattern | xargs perl -pi -E 's/original-words/replaced-words/g'

# when pattern become complex:

ack-grep -l  /complex-pattern/  >  TMP.FILE
cat TMP.FILE | xargs perl -pi -E 's/original-words/replaced-words/g'


xargs

basically the list of files generated
by ack are being appended to the end of the perl -pi -E
's/pattern/replacemnt/g' command.

perl -pi

The -p option causes Perl to create a loop around your program which iterates
over filename arguments. 

The -i option causes Perl to edit the file in place.  

The -E option causes Perl to execute the
one line of code specified as the program. In our case the program is just a
Perl regex substitution.
