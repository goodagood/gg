This dir exists because:
Stupid coffeescript like to wrap all in function:
-- And it not work, because path changing, 

    function(){
    }.call(this)


Use coffee -b option to get ride of the wrapping to load in node.js REPL.

    coffee -b -o this/must/by/folder  -c /the/src/file/path/must/follow/here
