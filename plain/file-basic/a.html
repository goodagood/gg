    This might be stupid.

    <h1> Try a video </h1>
    <div>
        <video controls width="320"   height="180" >
            <source src="/gglocal/small2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Can you think no video tag support?
        </video>
    </div>

    <p>
    I am trying to set up a <a href="/gglocal/./intro.html">file system</a> to
    do things the old way: everything could be plain and simple file.  The
    everything can be a lot, such as texts, codes, designs, plans, working
    reports, audio/video records, communication and sharing and more.  But it
    should be files and folders, this is basic.
    </p>

    <p>
    The file system must be web accessible, and can go through different
    devices, so we can use it from many places, with many equipments.  In
    case it need modifications, we can ask our friend to help working those
    files.  This can be nice, it must support sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
    By staying with basic files, things return to simple.  The web UI can be
    complex, it make people facing new fancy useless interfaces, it keep
    pushing people away from the truth.  The truth is we have files, it can
    support nearly all kind of communication and co-operations.  Don't cheat
    and steal data away, give files, do things with plain and simple files.
    When people want it, give them their files.
    </p>

    <p>
    Files should be able to get values. Because people make it, so the value
    comes.
    In techical details, this means we set up meta
    data for files.  And we can set more attributes others want to set for
    their file, we don't know what.
    </p>

    <p>
    Actually, Unix/Linux and many good systems is designed to work this
    way for long time, but as time past, a lot good traditions has been washed
    away by foolish websites.  Let's return to the simple
    way: make a file and keep the file, share and value the file.
    </p>

    

    <!-- the rest -->
    <p>
        The web got web pages, blogs, chattings, videos and more.  But I know
        they are all files, so the web is trying to hide the truth that it's 
        file, same as files in my computer.  I want 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Unix/*nix system is based on files, if everything is file, we can
        use file to do everything.  This make a lot job simple, so,
        *nix system works this way in most times.
    </p>
    <p>
        In digital era, a lot of our job can be represented by files.  In the
        same way, a lot of our life time can be represented by files, such as
        photos, audios and videos.  In modern era, all of our material belongings
        are represented by money.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then it is a natural

        And test we can get image and css in the folder. The a.css has:
        h1 {background-color: green;}
    </p>
    <h1> Can i has green? </h1>

    <!-- test we can get css in the folder: -->
    <img src="/file/get/abc/test/29.jpg" height=300 width=500 />
