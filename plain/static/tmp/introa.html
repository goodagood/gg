    This might be stupid.

    I am trying to set up a file system to interface between the modern web
    and myself.  In recent years, The web becomes so complex, it make me lost
    when finding where is my data.  So I want to set up what I believe capable
    to hold my data, and works.  But after a few monthes start to script on
    the file system, I tried to think about the reasons again, and find out
    the better answer for myself: I am one of the stupid to do the hopeless
    re-invention.
    
    But anyway, files and folders should be simpler compare to playing with
    more and more overly fancy web forms.  Let's pass to next question, what
    the file system should do?

    Beside those basics functions of a web file system:

    1, We should be able to share files, so friends can help us working on it.

    2, Files should be able to get value, because we work on them.  
    
    3, We should be able to put many thing or everything as files, because
    it's often heard: every thing is file. ...
    
    4, Files can have different presentations, if file is body, presentations
    should put on as clothes.
    
    5, it's better to be able to work from command line.

    6, ......


    
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    The web UI can be complex,  it keeps people facing new fancy useless interfaces, it keep
    pushing people away from the truth.  The truth is we have files, it can
    support nearly all kind of communication and co-operations.  Don't cheat
    and steal data away, give files, do things with plain and simple files.
    When people want it, give them their files.
    </p>

    <p>
    Files should be able to get values. Because people make it, so the value
    comes.
    In techical details, this means we set up meta
    data for files.  And we can set more attributes others want to set for
    their file, we don't know what.
    </p>

    <p>
    Actually, Unix/Linux and many good systems is designed to work this
    way for long time, but as time past, a lot good traditions has been washed
    away by foolish websites.  Let's return to the simple
    way: make a file and keep the file, share and value the file.
    </p>
    

    <!-- the rest -->
    <p>
        The web got web pages, blogs, chattings, videos and more.  But I know
        they are all files, so the web is trying to hide the truth that it's 
        file, same as files in my computer.  I want 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Unix/*nix system is based on files, if everything is file, we can
        use file to do everything.  This make a lot job simple, so,
        *nix system works this way in most times.
    </p>
    <p>
        In digital era, a lot of our job can be represented by files.  In the
        same way, a lot of our life time can be represented by files, such as
        photos, audios and videos.  In modern era, all of our material belongings
        are represented by money.

        Then it is a natural

    <h1> Try a video </h1>
    <div>
        <video controls width="320"   height="180" >
            <source src="/file/get/abc/test/small2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Can you think no video tag support?
        </video>
    </div>

    <p>
        And test we can get image and css in the folder. The a.css has:
        h1 {background-color: green;}
    </p>
    <h1> Can i has green? </h1>

    <!-- test we can get css in the folder: -->
    <img src="/file/get/abc/test/29.jpg" height=300 width=500 />

</div>
<!-- end of first div in body, as a container -->
