Each file can has an value attribute, we can value it as 2 cents or any other
value.

# When we deal with value itself

When we want claim a value seperatly, let"s put value as json data.  json is
simple data structure for every one, it looks as a text file with the
following lines:

    {
        "value":     "0.02",
        "currency":  "USD",
        "user-id":   "gg-cat",
        "date":      "2015 11-23 19:18",

        "forWhat": "I told my friend (such as facebook/google user) the project"
        "details": "He said he was not stupid enough to follow me",
        "description":   "...",
        "more-things": "...",
        ...
    }

The 'value', 'currency', and some kind of description is required.  The
more detailed data specification is not defined now (2015 1123).

Just write some thing like the above json, and put it as a file with name: 

    some-file-name.json

Such kind of file is good enough for a value records.  Upload the file to one
folder of our user named: 'jobs', then we can start the valueing process.
This would be great.


# Reason about value and file value

Everything connected to our human beings get value, we can mark it by money
tags in different currencies.  Like it or hate it, the system imposed on our
humble human beings. Value and money is kind of engineerings designed by God,
it overcast onto our societies for all nations and countries.

So let's value everything in our system, including all contribution from all
possible contributors, who can be technique savvy or not.  

If you contribute anything to the system, you can claim value for it.  It can
be anything, such as software codes, designs, writtings related and any thing
that inteligent beings can understand.  The value must be estimated by others,
and finally accepted by those who can pay it.  Thus we follow the natural
rule:  you get the value when they pay it, maybe in cash.

For programmers, let's put codes into 
[a public github repository](https://github.com/goodagood/gg).  So you can
clone it and start to do coding.  Or you can do other things for the system,
such as write some text about it and tell your friends about it.

Then you can value your contribution as with a json file, as an example:

    {
        "value": 5,
        "currency": "USD",
        "job": "I do a css design for your web page",
        "details": "...",
        "description": "..."
    }





Then upload the file to user named 'jobs', he can accept files from all users.
Then we can start the valueing process and accumulate it.  It simple. The file
type above is Json file, it's text file, it's also simple.
